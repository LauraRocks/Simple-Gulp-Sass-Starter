# Very simple setup for using SCSS with GULP

This is a super simple example how to use Gulp with Sass

## How to Use it
Just run `npm install` and then `gulp watch` to start working.

## How SASS Compiling happens
Use .scss files and put them under scss folder. See gulpfile for more.

All scss will compile to one file under /dist/css/style.css
